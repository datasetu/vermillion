Vermillion is a high performance, scalable and secure IoT middleware platform developed using `Vertx <https://vertx.io>`_. It is a middleware stack which focuses primarily on the compute layer in a smart city IoT deployment. One of the chief goals of Vermillion is to enable seamless data exchange between data producers and consumers in a smart city.

Architecture
============

   :align: center

The HTTPS APIs are written using `vertx <https://vertx.io>`_. The datastore used is `elasticsearch <https://elastic.co>`_, and the authentication and authorisation mechanism is using the `datasetu auth server <http://auth.datasetu.org>`_. A detailed architecture diagram for developers is in the works.

Performance
===========

Performance has been *the* key consideration while developing Vermillion. Initial results show that the middleware was able to handle at least ``130,000`` HTTPS requests/sec across ``18`` compute nodes. Computing Vermillion's performance under various conditions is still ongoing. 

A detailed white paper on this project published in Arxiv can be found `here <https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08361>`_. The code for this setup and tests can be found in release 0.2.0. The following is a graph depicting results from the 18-node test:

Quickstart
==========

#. Install the following dependencies:
  
     - docker
     - docker-compose
     - maven
  
   To run tests
  
     - python3
     - behave

#. Package the API server into a fat jar:

   .. code-block:: shell
   
    cd vermillion/api-server
    mvn clean package

#. Similarly package the authenticator

   .. code-block:: shell
    
    cd authenticator
    mvn clean package
  
#. Once the jar files are ready

   .. code-block:: shell
   
    cd setup
    ./install
     
#. To run tests

   .. code-block:: shell
    
    cd tests
    behave

Work on API documentation, developer docs and a stable release is ongoing
