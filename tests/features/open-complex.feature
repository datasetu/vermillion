        Scenario: Complex query with empty coordinates
                Given Vermillion is running
                When The complex query coordinates are empty
                Then The response status should be 400

        Scenario: Complex query with invalid coordinates
                Given Vermillion is running
                When The complex query coordinates are invalid
                Then The response status should be 400

        Scenario: Complex query with string coordinates
                Given Vermillion is running
                When The complex query coordinates are strings
                Then The response status should be 400

        Scenario: Complex query with empty distance
                Given Vermillion is running
                When The complex query distance is empty
		Then The response status should be 400
	
	Scenario: Complex query with invalid distance
                Given Vermillion is running
                When The complex query distance is invalid
                Then The response status should be 400

        Scenario: Complex query with time not present
                Given Vermillion is running
                When The complex query time is not present
                Then The response status should be 400

        Scenario: Complex query with distance not present
                Given Vermillion is running
                When The complex query distance is not present
                Then The response status should be 400

        Scenario: Complex query with just resource attributes as payload
                Given Vermillion is running
